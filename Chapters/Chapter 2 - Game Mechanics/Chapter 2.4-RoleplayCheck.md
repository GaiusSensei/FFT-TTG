Roleplay Checks
---
In the course of playing FFT-TTG, each player assumes the role of his characters. Most players usually stick to their 'primary' character, but not all. Sooner or later, however, a conflict arises while they're out of combat- these are called Roleplay Checks. There are two kinds of Roleplay Checks in FFT-TTG: the Versus Environment Checks and the Versus NPC Checks.  

**Roleplay Versus Environment**
When resolving a non-combat conflict against the environment, just roll the dice normally (3d6) and add an Ability Bonus for every 2 points above 10 for the ability that best helps your character during the conflict. The Game Master may give you penalties if the conflict is particularly rough. Here's a short list of examples:  

1. Strength - Lifting heavy objects, pushing or pulling loads  
2. Vitality - Resisting diseases or poison, fighting fatigue, ignoring the effects of serious wounds or exhaustion.  
3. Speed - Running, jumping, catching items, dodging traps  
4. Magic - Remembering information, spouting lore  
5. Spirit - Resisting a mental effect or insanity, influencing a crowd  

**Roleplay Versus an NPC**
Resolving a non-combat conflict against an NPC is a bit different. You don't have any Ability Bonus, but instead convince the Game Master to give you bonuses by playing the part- whether if its bartering with the shopkeeper or influencing your jailer. Take note that the Game Master may give you penalties instead! If you manage to convince your Game Master to give you bonuses, roll the dice (3d6) and any modifiers to see if you managed to do what you intended to do.
