Gaming Equipment

In order to play FFT-TTG (in real life, and not in Roll20.net), you are going to need the following equipment:

1. Pen & Paper for each Player. Some index cards may be handy for the Game Master.
2. 3x six-sided dice (d6) for each Player. You may share dice if there aren't enough.
3. Enough Miniatures for each Player; Take note that one player may control more than one Character at a time.
4. A Square Grid.
5. A four-sided die (d4), an eight-sided die (d8), a ten-sided die (d10) and a twelve-sided die (d12) for damage. Just one each is enough, just share it among the players.
