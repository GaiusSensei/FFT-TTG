On this chapter, we will discuss the mechanics of playing this tabletop game. Bear in mind that this game is designed to be played with Miniatures on a Square Grid, using Dice to resolve conflicts and deal damage. Of course, Pen and Paper is also needed for players to keep track of the statuses of their character(s). If you don't have enqough equipment, or if your players are not in the same room as you or your other players, you may use the http://roll20.net site, which this rulebook fully supports.
