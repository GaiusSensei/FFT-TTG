Resolving Conflicts
---
Whenever a conflicts occurs in the game, such as when one of the player's characters attack an opponent and they need to decide whether the attack hit or not, the Game Master will ask the player to 'Roll the Dice'. This ensures that the game is fair by adding a random element in each conflict. In order to resolve a conflict, the following steps should be taken:  

1. After the Game Master asks a player to 'Roll the Dice', the player should first calculate the number of bonuses their character has, such as a Backstab Bonus, a magical Battle Song Bonus, or a Trained Skill Bonus.  
2. The Game Master will do the same, but instead of bonuses, the GM will count the number penalties that the character has, such as two counts of Concealed Target penalty (Full Concealment), Hostile Environment penalty, and so on.  
3. After all bonuses and penalties are tallied, the player will roll three (3) six-sided (d6) dice, and add to the result the number of bonuses they have, before subtracting the number of penalties they have.  
4. If the final result of the roll is less than 10, then the player has failed. If the roll is 10 to 17, then the player has suceeded. If the roll is 18 or above, then the player has suceeded magnificently, and triggers a Critical Success. The effects of a Critical Success depends on the conflict being resolved, as well as the Game Master.  

Critical Failure: When a roll's result is three ones (a 'natural' 3), even before adding bonuses, the roll automatically fails.
